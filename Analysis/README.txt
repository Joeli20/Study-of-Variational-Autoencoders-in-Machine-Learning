This folder contains "IrisTest.m" which is a test presented in the report of the thesis in the refactoring and results chapters. It trains the Iris dataset with a fixed structure and optimisation algorithm.

It also contains a script for the MNIST dataset to train the autoencoder and generate some random images from what it sees in the dataset.
